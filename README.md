CSS TASK 1 and TASK 2
Responsive Animated Webpage Demo
Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I've created a simple responsive and animated webpage using HTML and CSS for a task. This is a showcase of a responsive layout with a header, main content, and footer. The main content includes a fade-in animation and a button hover effect. The design is also mobile-friendly and incorporates a gradient background.

You can check out the live demo by running a local server. Here's how you can do it:

Clone the repository: git clone  https://github.com/kannan76/CSS-Task.git


Navigate to the project directory:

Start a local server. For Python users: python -m http.server

Feel free to explore the code and let me know your thoughts. I'm open to feedback and suggestions for improvements. This is just a simple example, and there's room for customization and enhancement.

Looking forward to your comments! ðŸ˜„ðŸš€
